"It's been a long while since I've seen you in these parts, Conner. You mostly keep to the road these days?"

Conner
"Ah, you know me too well, Alric. Can't resist the call of adventure. Just back from a scouting mission for the Lord to the north. The stormcloaks have been restless."

Alric
"Stormcloaks, you say? They've always been a thorn in our side. What's the word on their movements?"

Conner
"Rumors of a coalition forming. If they're actively gathering more fighters, we might have trouble on our hands."

Alric
"At least it's not quiet, right? But it feels more dangerous these days. What are you planning? More scouting?"

Conner
"I'd rather not, but the Lord wants eyes on them. I'll have to find a few more trustworthy souls to join me, maybe a mage or two."

Alric
"Terrible idea! You know they tend to get lost in their books when you need them most. Have you thought of taking a bard? They do have a knack for distractions."

Conner
"Good point! Although I worry about what story they'll bring backâ€”I can't handle another saga about how tough the road was! But... perhaps their charm wouldn't hurt in the midst of conflict."

Alric
"Hah! Well, better to have an entertaining escape than empty pockets. Here's hoping you won't need the bard. Let's enjoy tonight before the adventure calls you away again."

Conner
"I'll drink to that. A night of revelry before the shadows come creeping back."
